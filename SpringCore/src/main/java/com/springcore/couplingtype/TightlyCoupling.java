//Tight coupling from example: 
//1. subject class is fully depend on topic class

//2. if we change topic class understand() to gotit() then we need to change in subject class also

//3. subject class is tightly couple with topic class

//4. Tight coupling does not provide the concept of interface.

//5. In Tight coupling, it is not easy to swap the codes between two classes
