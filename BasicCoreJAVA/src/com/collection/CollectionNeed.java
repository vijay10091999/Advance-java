public class CollectionNeed {

	//collection in java -> farmework or group that provides an archietecure 
	//to store manupulate the group of object
	
	
	//Need -> we want to store 1000 studnet name -
	//intialize each instatnce variable -> bad approche
	//-> to avoid above sitution use Array
	
	//limitations -> it is an fixed size. it contains homogeneous data.
	
	//to overcome both situation we used collection framework.- ArrayList
	
	//1.collection are growable in nature.we can increase and decrease the size.
	//2.collection hold homogenous and heterogenous object
	//3. collection only hold objects not primitive type .
	//4.every collection class is implemented base on standarad data structure so that we get inbuild structure.
	
	//difference b/w collection and collections
	//1.collection is interface .. it is use when we want to do operation with single unit of object.
	//2.collections is utility class that provide direct method for operation of collection object.
	
	//child interface of collection : List,Queue,Set 
	
	//1. List -> ArrayList ,LinkedList , Vector, Stack
	//2. Queue ->  PriorityQueue , Deque - ArrayDeque , LinkedListDeque
	//3. Set -> HashSet , LinkedHashSet, SortedSet,TreeSet
